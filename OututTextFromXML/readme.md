I had a mentor a long time ago that told me a development rule. 

"make it work, then make it pretty" 

So I took that approach, I have given you two files. 

php_exercise_completed_1_38_minutes_dity.php

php_exercise_clean.php

I wrote the first one is just over an hour and a half just a messy bit to figure out the data and format, I probably spent the last 20 minutes dealing with two lines were Sunday was last instead of first some reason. 

After I was done I refactored it into a super simple class. 

I was expecting you would run both of these in the terminal 

ChristophersMBP: christopherfrench$ php php_exercise_clean.php > output_key_result.txt

There are no external libraries. 

The result of my diff contains no empty return at the end I decided not to add that.
